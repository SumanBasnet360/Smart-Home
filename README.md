This project is a miniature model of a smart home. Its a part of my minor project in college.

I've used ESP 32 Dev Kit V1 as the microcontroller and server.

AHT 10 sensor is used for monitoring the temperature and humidity.

Here's an overview of the web interface for controlling and monitoring the Smart Home
